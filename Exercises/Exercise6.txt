Create A web api for ShopItems:
ShopItem should have Name, Quantity.

Allow CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
Use Postgre and Dapper to connect and perform queries.
ConnectionString should be present in AppSettings.json

Extra:
1. All Database actions should be in Repository layer.
2. Create a separate project for database code. Api should now know what Repository uses.
3. Validate that Name is unique and that Name is longer than 5 characters and that Quantity is more than 0. 
Use FluentValidation library for validation.
4. Research the best way for opening, closing postgre connections.
