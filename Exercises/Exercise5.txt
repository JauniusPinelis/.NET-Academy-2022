You will create an application which will collect and save Weather data:

1. Find a weather api which would work for you (should have trial or free)
You will get an API-Key, that you will need to add to your requests.

Your API should have the following endpoints:

1. An endpoint for fetching data from your selected Weather api and save it into text file.
You should be filter by date and location. And you dont need to get all properties:
just temperature, wind speed and description? (dont waste time mapping all properties).
Tip (in visual studio you can paste json and it will create a class for you.) 

2. An endpoint where you get back all the data from text file. Please remap with Automapper into DTO.
When writing and reading from file, please use Async.
