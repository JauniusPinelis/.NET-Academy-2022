1. Register a personal account with Github.
2. Research .gitignore file. Why is it needed:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/ignore-files?view=azure-devops&tabs=visual-studio-2019

The Exercise:
You will create a school management system.
We will have Modules and Classes. Module can have multiple classes.

Module will have the following information
Name, CreatedDate, UpdateDate, Description.

Class:
Name, CreatedDate, Description, Location (string)

The Application will allow us to:
1. Add Module
2. Add Class
3. Assign Class to a Module.
4. Print Information of specific Module (with classes)
-> Print Module ComputerSciene
-> <Name> <CreatedDate> ... <all class names separated by comma> 
5. Classes and Modules should be stored in separated text files.
(they should be connected by id).  
Tip -> Take max id and increment it by one select(a => a.Id).Max()
5. The class, module information should be persistent.

Tips:
Use Generic Filestore to store Module and Class
Use Extensoion method to print DateTime into 'dd/yyyy/mm, hh'
Use Inheritance of abstract Model.

6. Create a github Repository with .gitignore
7. Push you code into that repository;

I want a working version of you system in repository;
It has to be a working version.
