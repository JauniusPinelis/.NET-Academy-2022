Create a new solution.

We will be creating a console shop application
with the following commands:

1. "Add <itemname> <price>"
2. "Remove <Itemname>"
3. "Show balance" -> displays your balance (initial balance is 20 euros)
4. "Topup <money>" -> topup your balance;
5. "Buy <itemname>" -> buys an item if the buyer has enough money.
6.. "Display items" -> displays all items that you have bought.

The information should be saved into a file. 
That means when you restart the information does not dissappear.

Non-functonal:
1. Try Service-oriented approach.
2. Sensible console messages.


Advanced:
Try error handling with try/catch.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Create a new Nunit project and try to cover your program with UnitTests.
2. Create an interface for FileSaver and use Moq (mocking) to replace this dependency.
3. Try to cover your commands with unit tests.
4. Investigate how can you check code coverage of your tests.
