1. Homework is to show what you learnt, can do.

What do we grade on:
1. Functionality
2. Solution architecture, exception-handling with custom exceptions, validation, no logic in infrastructure, repositories,
Everything has the right place.
3. Unit tests
Mocking, interfaces, aaa, reusing code, InlineData.
4. Naming, consistency, clean code, (Do I understand the code quickly)
5. Nuget: Autofixture (maybe too complex), Dapper, AutoMapper, Moq, FluentValidation (suprise me)
6. Nice Extras: Docker-compose, integration-tests, CI (build restore test)
7. REST API design: 
    standard endpoints/routes;
    identify resources;
    Meaningfull status codes 200, 204, 201, 400 (with error message), 404, 500
    Documentation, Swagger
    idempotency;
8. DB: LiquidBase, good dapper usage, DB Schema:
Mapping one to many, mapping many to many, foreign keys, primary keys, constrains, naming schema, seeding data,
indexes.
9. Readme.md
