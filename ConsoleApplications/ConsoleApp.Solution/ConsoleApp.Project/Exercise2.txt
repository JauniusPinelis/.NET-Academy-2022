Create a new solution.

We will be creating a console shop application
with the following commands:

1. "Add <itemname> <price>"
2. "Remove <Itemname>"
3. "Show balance" -> displays your balance (initial balance is 20 euros)
4. "topup <money>" -> topup your balance;
5. "display items" -> displays all items that you have bought.

The information should be saved into a file. 
That means when you restart the information does not dissappear.

Non-functonal:
1. Try Service-oriented approach.

Advanced:
Try error handling with try/catch.
